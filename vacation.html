<h3>Blue Lagoon</h3>
<p>This popular man-made geothermal spa of crystal clear water is the only site on earth you can swim in 40 degree centigrade water year round, and yet be encircled by ice and snow. An area where a by-product of the Svartsengi geothermal power plant is located, the lagoon's rich mineral content is known to be helpful to a variety of settings. The icy aquamarine waters set alongside the black background of the plain landscape make this glaring contrast even more impressive making it the most photographed attraction in Iceland.</p>

<h3>Lake Myvatn</h3>
<p>Established as a conservation area in 1974, this place has turn to be one of the best tourist attractions. There's much to discover here such as the waterfall of the Gods, which is considered the most famous waterfall in Europe. One can also see the lavishness of bird-life, volcanic craters as well as beautiful lakes.<p>
